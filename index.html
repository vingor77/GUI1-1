        <h1 class="title">What are the Backrooms?</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                The Backrooms is a creative concept designed by a multitude of authors working in tandem to produce a horror-filled collection of spaces, called levels, that reside outside of the reality we know.<br>
                Levels are not what makes up the Backrooms entirely. There are four main categories that authors may write about and submit to the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/" target="_blank">wikidot</a> page. 
                These are Levels, Entities, Objects, and Groups.<br>
                <b><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/normal-levels-i" target="_blank">Levels</a></b> are the primary thing that makes up the Backrooms physically. Levels are spaces of physical existance that where Entities, Objects, and Groups can exist on.
                Levels can be pretty much whatever you desire it to be, whether it be a warehouse, a parking garage, or even a forest. The possibilities are truly endless! 
                As of Thursday May 8th, 2023 (the day of writing this), there are over 400 levels.<br>
                <b><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entities" target="_blank">Entities</a></b> are the living, and in some cases undead, beings that live inside of the Backrooms. These beings can vary greatly similar to levels. 
                An entity may be a disease or fungus, something that looks like a human, or even just a bright white smile inside of a dark room. Entities make up a significant portion of the horror aspect baked into the Backrooms.
                Entities "spawn" only inside of certain levels of the Backrooms. Some may be able to appear in any level while some may only appear on a certain level or under certain conditions.<br>
                <b><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/objects" target="_blank">Objects</a></b> are items that can be found laying around the Backrooms. These can be anywhere from almond water (not milk) and juice all the way to keys and machinery. Most objects can be found on most levels, but some have
                specific levels in which it may appear.<br>
                <b><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/groups-list" target="_blank">Groups</a></b> are bands of people who have <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/phenomenon-5" target="_blank">no-clipped</a> into the Backrooms and decided to form a team for some purpose. As there is no blatant escape from the Backrooms once there, most groups tend to work towards
                finding a way out.<br>
                Below are examples with images.

                    Level 0 is an endless assault of mono-yellow walls and carpet with a constant buzzing from the fluorescent lights above. No entities, objects, or groups appear or live on this level. 
                    Many wanderers die here due to going insane from constant buzzing or from dehydration.<br>
                    Below is an example of the sound you would hear if you were in level 0.

                    Level 1 is a parking garage with many doors and hallways, abandoned cars, and streaks of unknown liquid. Three types of entites live on this level, being
