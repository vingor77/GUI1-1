        <blockquote>
            <p>
                The Backrooms is a creative concept designed by a multitude of authors working in tandem to produce a horror-filled collection of spaces, called levels, that reside outside of the reality we know.
                Levels are not what makes up the Backrooms entirely. There are four main categories that authors may write about and submit to the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/" target="_blank">wikidot</a> page. 
                These are Levels, Entities, Objects, and Groups.<br>
            </p>

                    <b>Levels</b> are the primary thing that makes up the Backrooms physically. 
                    Levels are spaces of physical existance where Entities, Objects, and Groups can exist on.
                    Levels can be pretty much be whatever you desire it to be, whether it be a warehouse, a parking garage, or even a forest. The possibilities are truly endless!
                </td>
                <td>
                    <b>Entities</b> are the living, and in some cases undead, beings that live inside of the Backrooms. These beings can vary greatly similar to levels. 
                    An entity may be a disease or fungus, something that looks like a human, or even just a bright white smile inside of a dark room. Entities make up a significant portion of the horror aspect baked into the Backrooms.
                    Entities "spawn" only inside of certain levels of the Backrooms. Some may be able to appear in any level while some may only appear on a certain level or under certain conditions.
                </td>
                <td>
                    <b>Objects</b> are items that can be found laying around the Backrooms. These can be anywhere from almond water (not milk) and juice all the way to keys and machinery. Most objects can be found on most levels, but some have
                    specific levels in which it may appear.
                </td>
                <td>
                    <b>Groups</b> are bands of people who have <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/phenomenon-5" target="_blank">no-clipped</a> into the Backrooms and decided to form a team for some purpose. As there is no blatant escape from the Backrooms once there, most groups tend to work towards
                    finding a way out.

                    Level 1 is a parking garage with many doors and hallways, abandoned cars, and streaks of unknown liquid. Three types of entites live on this level, being
                    <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-3" target="_blank">Smilers</a>,
                    <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-8" target="_blank">Hounds</a>, and

                    Level 2 is a series of long, straight hallways with pipes lining the walls, vents shaking, and loud machinery running in the distance. This is considered to be the most deadly low number level in the Backrooms.

                    This is entity 3, also known as the
                    <i><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-3" target="_blank">Smiler</a></i>
                    Smilers are probably the most common entity to find while wandering inside the Backrooms. If there is darkness, there is likely to be a Smiler lurking and watching.
                    These entities can live on any level, but primarily exist on levels 2 and 3. Below is a list of thing to do when encountering a Smiler:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep eye contact. Walk away slowly and calmly.</li>
                        <li>Keep as quiet as possible, Smilers attack sound.</li>
                        <li>Turn off light sources. Smilers attack light as well as sound.</li>
                        <li>Use a <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-3" target="_blank">Smiler Repellent</a> to repel it.</li>

                    <!--Entity 10.-->
                    This is entity 10, also known as the
                    <i><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-10" target="_blank">Skin-Stealer</a></i>
                    Skin-Stealers are likely to be the second most common entity in the Backrooms, beat out only by the Smilers. These entities reside on all levels, but primarily on 1, 2, and 3.
                    Skin-Stealers get nutrients from killing a victim and taking thier skin. There are small sticky surfaces all over the entity's body that creates the illusion of a human, while also gathering nutrients from said skin. 
                    There is a saying to find out whether it is a Skin-Stealer or a human. It goes <b>Blood runs red, they're not dead. Blood runs clear, don't get near.</b> Humans bleed red while Skin-Stealers bleed clear.
                    Skin-stealers may be docile when nutrients are supplied, but the moment it regains its hunger, it becomes a threat to all humans nearby.
                    Below is a list of things to do and not do when encountering a Skin-Stealer:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do walk away slowly and calmly similar to a Smiler. This only works in docile state.</li>
                        <li>Do Check anyone you are travelling with for clear blood.</li>
                        <li>Do not trust people who barely speak or spurt random words.</li>
                        <li>Do not aggravate a docile Skin-Stealer.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <!--Entity 17 with a table to describe symptoms.-->

                    <i><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-17" target="_blank">Crawler Fungus</a></i>
                    The Crawler Fungus is a little bit different than a normal entity. It isn't an actual being in and of itself, but rather a virus or disease of sorts. There are 5 stages of infection which only takes roughly 12 minutes
                    to fully infect.

                    and is the primary object that can be found inside of all levels of the Backrooms. Almond water is the main source of water inside the Backrooms and has become a highly valuable object.
                    Almond water is found in thermoses containing 3-5 cups worth of Almond Water inside of it, with the color of the bottle changing based on the flavor of the Almond Water inside of it.
                    There are four types currently discovered: gray, green, red, and blue. Almond Water can repel/tame entities, cure some diseases, sate thirst, and reduce anxiety-type symptoms.

                    Smiler Repellent used to be the best way to deal with Smilers, but recent developments have caused Smiler Repellent to become useless to Smilers. The wikidot page has updates on it
                    showing that the usage went from critical to irrelevant.

                    which is a group of people who worship an entity known as <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-180" target="_blank">Berry</a>.
                    Berry is a cat entity that has supernatural power over people who look it in the eyes for long enough and can communicate secrets and truths untold. This is the backbone of the Visionaries of Berry.
                    The group communicates through necklaces made from Berry's collar which allows telepathic communication regardless of distance between all who wear them.

                    Jerry is a bird entity that is considered and worshipped as though is a god through a supernatural power, similar to Berry the cat. Essentially, The Followers of Jerry are the same as the
                    Visionaries of Berry except they worship a bird instead of a cat. These two groups dislike each other similar to how a cat and bird are known to not get along.

                    <i><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/backrooms-remodeling-co" target="_blank">Backrooms Remodeling Co</a></i>
                    which is a militaristic-style remodeling company consisting of non-human black figures with the sole purpose of remodeling things. This group comes in and changes everything about a level sometimes
                    and may even split a level into sub-levels called <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/sub-layers" target="_blank">sub-layers</a>. From what can be assumed, this group has good intentions
                    and just wishes to make the Backrooms a better place in general, but it seems as though most recent attempts have lead to catastrophe and death.
